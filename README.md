# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide collects and organizes the most important learning concepts from my prework modules in my full stack flex bootcamp. Topis include Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I deepened my understanding of the topic's key concepts by putting newly acquired skills into action. I also became more familiar with GitBash, VSCode, Google Chrome Dev, Git flow, and a variety of keyboard shortcuts. I am now able to reference the material in an easily accesible and organized location.

## Usage

The guide is organized into four study areas for student review including Git, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. First, visit the webpage and open the DevTools console by pressing Control+Shift+I (Windows) or Command+Option+I (MacOS). Next, view the "console" tab. JavaScript will randomly pick one of the four content areas for you to study first. A new random selection is made when the page is refreshed.
